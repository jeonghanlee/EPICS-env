### Commment by myself
### BASE default configuration INSTALL_LOCATION is defined as .
### with no INSTALL_LOCATION definition. However, if we define INSTALL_LOCATION,
### We have to face the error due to them, RULE_DIRS error. 
### So, if we define INSTALL_LOCATION, we have to set LINKER_ORIGIN_ROOT to cover
### INSTALL_LOCATION of base, and its SOURCE code location.
