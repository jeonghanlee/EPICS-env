## However, it is easy to handle empty variable within buildrules_BUILDER and a_buildrule_BUILDER

### There is no automatica way to detect all modules depedencies per each module. 
### At least one place we have to define. Typically, conf.module rule should be defined
### when we have to look at each makefile, RELEASE, CONFIG_SITE, and so on. 
### Sometimes, we have to change building codes (Makefile) a bit. So, ideas come from
### there.
### This approach is a bit more manual intervention we have to, but at this moment
### I like this approach, because all building rules are generated by automatic rule 
### builder 
###
### Please see RULES_MODS_BUILD for further detailed information
